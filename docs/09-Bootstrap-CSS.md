# Bootstrap CSS

For the sake of making things a tad prettier, [download the CSS from Bootstrap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fyockm/bootstrap-css-only/master/css/bootstrap.min.css), and place it in your project's _css_ directory.

Include the new stylesheet just below where we include our (still empty) custom sylesheet:

_index.html_
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min.css">
```
