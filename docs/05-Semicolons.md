# Syntax: The Mighty Semicolon

I threw something else in that last statement: A semicolon!

```js
alert('Welcome to the page!');
console.log('Successfully displayed and dismissed alert.');
```

Semicolons are used to separate one JavaScript statement from the next. Most of the time, putting each statement on its own line is good enough, and the semicolon is unnecessary. Sometimes, however, we need the semicolon to clarify ambiguities in our code. Using a semicolon also allows us to put multiple statements on a single line.

```js
alert('Welcome to the page!'); console.log('Success!');
```

I suggest that you get in the habit of using semicolons at the end of every statement. I'll be using them in all examples from here on.

So now we can print text in an irritating popup for users to see. We could do more interesting stuff if we could get some input from the users.
